A statistical analysis of NFL tackling unsing R
Ben Millman | Undergraduate Track

The goal for the Big Data Bowl this year was to create metrics and evaluate players on aspects surrounding tackling. To this end I created a two. pronged approach.
 
 1. Logistic regression for predicting tackle probability as a function of distance to the ball.
 2. A recurrent nueral network to predict tackle locations.

With these two main features I generated further metrics to evaluate players. This was a challenging and engaging opportunity to combine 2 things I'm passionate about.
